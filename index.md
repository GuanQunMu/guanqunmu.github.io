## **Research Experience**


### **1. Designing the Control System for Zeeman Scan, Rabi Scan and Spin Echo Operations of Ca+ Qubits in Ion Traps**
>Mang Feng's Ion Trap Group, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics (WIPM), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), P. R. China  
March, 2019 -- September, 2020

  Applied by a laser with the rabi frequency, a two-level ion will continuously oscillates between the ground state and the excited state. Ones can achieve the quantum gate acting on a qubit by setting the rabi oscillation time, and this is called the rabi scan. An control system is essential to do it. We used The ARTIQ, which was initiated by the Ion Storage Group at NIST, as the control system for our experiements. It integrates FPGA, AOM and DDS, and one can design the experienment through Python. 
  
  In our group, as the main developer of the control system based on Artiq, I designed functions such as zeeman scan, rabi scan, AWG controling (to improve the fidelity of MS gates), spin echo (to increse the t2 of qubits) and quantum Lock-in amplifier (for quantum sensing). In addition, to customize the experimental process, I redesigned the GUI by Python.

### **2. Time Tagging of Photons emitted from Ion Traps**  
>Manas Mukherjee's Ion Trap Group, CQT, National University of Singapore (NUS)  
 June, 2019 -- September, 2019
 
As one of the solutions for particles constrained in a secondary potential well, the coherent state, witch approximates the classical trajectory, can be made and detected in an ion trap. To detect the coherent state, ones should apply a laser at a specific position, tag the time of the photon emitted by the excited ion when the wave packet moves to the same position, and observe the gap period between the time when the state is created and the time when a photon is detected.

It required an experimental control system to achieve it. With FPGA Programing (Verilog) and Python, I designed a system that can tag the time of photons emitted from ion traps. It contains communication between the PC and the FPGA with the JTAG protocol, and FPGA programs to collect, analyse and store the data of TTL signals from PMT and to tag the time of photons emission .

(b) The FPGA program: The binary bit string transmitted by the JTAG protocol can determine when to end the experiment; the signal from the PLL passes through the counter to determine the current time, waiting for the signal in the PMT to trigger.</small>

### **3. The Simulation of the Surface Code and Toric Code**  
>Yongjian Han's Theory Group, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) , Hefei, Anhui ,P. R. China
July, 2018 -- January, 2019

The fault-tolerant quantum computing, which is the next step of quantum computing, requires quantum error correction algorithm. One of its candidate is surface code, with the property that the logical fidelity can be improved as the number of physical qubits involved increases. However, it works only with the fidility of physical qubits gate under the threshold.

In order to find the threshold, I designed a program in javascript to simulate the surface code and toric code, explored their thresholds under specific conditions, and verified the properties: The fidelity of logic gates will be improved as the size of the qubits increases when its physical qubits error rate is under the threshold.

The x-axis represents the error rate of physical qubits gates, and the y represents the number of errors of encoded informations in 100,000 Monte Carlo samples. Different colors represent different array sizes. It shows that the threshold is 0.105.</small>
