### **Designing the Control System for Rabi Scan and Zeeman Scan of qubits in Ion Traps**
>Mang Feng's Ion Trap Group, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics (WIPM) ,Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)  
March, 2019 -- Now

  Applied by a laser with the rabi frequency, a two-level ion will continuously oscillates between levels. Ones can control the quantum gate acting on a qubit by setting the rabi oscillation time, which is called the rabi scan. An control system is required to achieve it. Artiq is adopted by ion trap groups from NIST and Oxford University as the control system of ion traps. It integrates FPGA, AOM and DDS, and can control experimental processes through Python. 
  
  In our group, as the main developer of the control system based on Artiq, I designed functions that can implement rabi scan and zeeman scan for qubits and paluse shaping for DDS to Reduce AC-Stark effect. In addition, to facilitate the experimental process, I made a custom GUI by Python.

### **Time Tagging of Photons emitted from Ion Traps**  
>Manas Mukherjee's Ion Trap Group, CQT, National University of Singapore (NUS)  
 June, 2019 -- September, 2019
 
As one of the solutions for particles constrained in a secondary potential well, the coherent state, witch approximates the classical trajectory, can be made and detected in an ion trap. To detect the coherent state, ones should apply a laser at a specific position, tag the time of the photon emitted by the excited ion when the wave packet moves to the same position, and observe the gap period between the time when the state is created and the time when a photon is detected.

It required an experimental control system to achieve it. With FPGA Programing (Verilog) and Python, I designed a system that can tag the time of photons emitted from ion traps. It contains communication between the PC and the FPGA with the JTAG protocol, and FPGA programs which can collect, analyse and store the data of TTL signals from PMT and tag the time of those photons .

(b) The FPGA program: The binary bit string transmitted by the JTAG protocol can determine when to end the experiment; the signal from the PLL passes through the counter to determine the current time, waiting for the signal in the PMT to trigger.

### **Simulation of the Surface Code and Toric Code**  
>Yongjian Han's Theory Group, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)  
July, 2018 -- January, 2019

As the number of qubits of a quantum computer increases, the error rate of the final result will increase exponentially. Therefore, the surface code was designed to avhieve fault-tolerant quantum computing, which demands that the error of a single gate is below a certain threshold.

I designed a program in javascript to simulate the operation of the surface code and toric code, explored their thresholds under specific conditions, and verified the properties of them: The fidelity of logic gates will increase as the size of the qubits increases when its logical error rate is below the threshold.

The x-axis represents the error rate of the logic gate, and the y represents the number of errors in 100,000 Monte Carlo samples. Different colors represent different array sizes. It can be found that the threshold is 0.105.
