## **Research Experience**


### **Designing the Control System for Zeeman Scan and Rabi Scan of qubits in Ion Traps**
>Mang Feng's Ion Trap Group, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics (WIPM) ,Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)  
March, 2019 -- Now

  Artiq is adopted by ion trap groups from NIST and Oxford University as the control system of ion traps. It integrates FPGA, AOM and DDS, and can control experimental processes through Python. Our group also adopted it for the operation of quantum information.
  
  As the main developer of Artiq in our group, I designed functions that can implement zeeman scan and rabi scan for qubits and paluse shaping for DDS to Reduce AC-Stark effect. In addition, Based on scalability of Python, I made a custom GUI to facilitate the experimental process.

### **Time Tagging of Photons emitted from Ion Traps**  
>Manas Mukherjee's Ion Trap Group, CQT, National University of Singapore (NUS)  
 June, 2019 -- September, 2019

With FPGA Programing (Verilog) and Python, I designed a system that can tag the time of photons emitted from ion traps. On the PC side, I made the GUI by Python, and implement communication between the PC and the FPGA with the JTAG protocol ,which is realized by Python. On the FPGA side, through Verilog and Quartus, I designed programs to collect, analyse and store the data of TTL signals from PMT. By comparing signals from the PMT with signals of PLLs, the system can tag the time when the photons are emitted from the ion traps.

This figure shows how does the system work in FPGA: From the binary bit string transmitted by the JTAG protocol on the far left, the data passes through the translator to determine when to end the experiment. In the meanwhile, the signal from the PLL passes through the counter to determine the current time, waiting for the signal in the PMT to trigger.

### **Simulation of the Surface Code and Toric Code**  
>Yongjian Han's Theory Group, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)  
July, 2018 -- January, 2019

The surface code and toric code are one of the most popular quantum error correction codes. (Widely used in superconducting quantum computing).

I designed a program in javascript to simulate the operation of the surface code and toric code, explored their thresholds under specific conditions, and verified their properties: The fidelity of logic gates will increase as the size of the qubits increases when its logical error rate is below the threshold.

(a) A two-dimensional array implementation of the surface code. (b) The fidelity of one logical qubit array. The x-axis represents the error rate of the logic gate, and the y represents the number of errors in 100,000 Monte Carlo samples. Different colors represent different array sizes. It can be found that the threshold is 0.1050.
